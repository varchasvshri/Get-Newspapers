# Get-Newspapers
Python script to download various leading newspapers directly instead of downloading each one of them individually.
We are not receiving any printed newspapers during the time of coronavirus, so for reading papers I had to download each one
of them individually which was cumbersome. So I scrapped the web for these newspaper and downloaded and maintained
each newspaper in their respective directory with their dates.
